# Age estimation and gender classification

In this project, I solved two tasks: given a photo, estimate age and gender of a person. Two different neural networks have been created and trained - the first by scratch, and the second via fine-tuning. Both neural networks have branch-like structure, which means that they can run training and inference for both tasks simultaneously.
